#. Translators: This is a very short warning that the CapsLock key
#. is active while trying to type in a password field. This warning
#. replaces the normal label (caption) of that password field while
#. CapsLock is active, so please keep it short. Please don't translate it
#. at all if the term "CapsLock" can reasonably expected to be understood
#. by the target audience.
#.
#. In particular, please don't translate this to death in German.
#. Simply leave it.
