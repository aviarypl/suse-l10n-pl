#
#For any message that uses argument substitution (i.e., there is a "{0}" in the string),
#  if you want to insert a single quote (i.e., "'"), you must put in two single quote characters ('').
#  In this case, the two single quotes in a row will be output as a solitary single quote (').
#  However, this is only true when doing argument substitution. If you use two single quotes
#  in a row in any other string, then they will show up as two single quotes ('').
#

## Fieldset is an HTML term.  Don't translate.
__fieldset=Fieldset

## Don't translate, not implemented.
__view_entry_selectbox=View Entry Selectbox

## Do not translate availableThemeIds

# Following this link there is an icon they should click on.
# Make sure the [[, ]] and == text are left in place in the translation. They are markup characters
editor.wikilink.tip=Tip: Use [[entry title]] to link to other entries in this folder, or click on the {0} \
editor toolbar button.<br/>Use ==Section name== and ===Subsection name=== to add sections and subsections to your text.

## Leave "&quot;" untranslated. This is notation for quotation marks. Quotation marks cannot be used directly in this string
