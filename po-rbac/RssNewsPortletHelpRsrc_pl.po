It uses a Resource Description Framework (RDF). An RDF description includes the authors of the resource, the date of creation or update, and the organization of the pages on a site (the site map). It also contains information that describes content in terms of audience or content rating, keywords for search engine data collection, subject categories, and so on. Using RDF data, many Web content providers create RDF Site Summary (RSS) files about their Web content and provide this data as an RSS feed, which is utilized by an RSS newsfeed portlet.\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003e&nbsp;\\u003c/p\\u003e \\u003cp\\u003eYour User Application Administrator can configure the contents of the portlet by modifying its preferences. The Administrator can configure the portlet to display content from multiple RSS feeds by adding additional News Feeds URLs. The Administrator can set the number of items to display per channel, set reload intervals for the news feed, set maximum number of URLs allowed, and specify whether the links open in a new browser window. The portlet displays the topic and items from each defined RSS feed onto a single display.\\u003c/p\\u003e"
